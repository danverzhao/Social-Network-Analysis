# Social-Network-Analysis
This is a school assignment, Dijkstra.c and CentralityMeasures.c is written by me and the rest are given by school.
In the graph nodes represent people and edges represent the connection of 2 people (if they are friends). In order to find "influencers" people who connected to alot of people. We first implement the Dijkstra's algorithem and then using it to calculate the closeness and betweenness centrality.
